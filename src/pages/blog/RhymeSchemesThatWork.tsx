        Quick: what's the first song lyric that pops into your head? Now think about why you remember it. Chances are, the rhyme scheme played a bigger role than you realize.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rhyming isn't just about making words sound nice together. It's a powerful memory device that's been used for thousands of years—from ancient oral poetry to today's chart-topping hits. Understanding how rhyme schemes work is like unlocking a cheat code for writing memorable lyrics.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">Why Rhymes Stick in Our Brains</h2>
      
      <p>
        Neuroscientists have discovered something fascinating: rhymes activate prediction centers in our brains. When we hear "I fell in love with you," our minds automatically start searching for words that rhyme with "you"—true, blue, knew, through.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the expected rhyme lands, we get a small dopamine hit. It's satisfying. Our brains reward us for successfully predicting the pattern. This is why rhyming lyrics are literally more pleasurable to listen to.
      </p>

      <p>
        But here's where it gets interesting: the <em>best</em> songwriters know how to play with these expectations.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">The Four Rhyme Schemes That Dominate Pop Music</h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-foreground">1. AABB (Couplets)</h3>
      <p>
        The most immediate, punchy rhyme scheme. Each line rhymes with the one right after it. Think of it like verbal one-two punches.
      </p>
      <p className="italic bg-muted/50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
        "We found love in a hopeless place / We found love in a hopeless place"
      </p>
      <p>
        Couplets create momentum. They're great for choruses and hooks because they feel complete and satisfying. The payoff comes fast.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-foreground">2. ABAB (Alternate Rhyme)</h3>
      <p>
        This is the workhorse of songwriting. Lines 1 and 3 rhyme; lines 2 and 4 rhyme. It creates a sense of interweaving, of ideas connecting across distance.
      </p>
      <p className="italic bg-muted/50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
        "Is this the real life? (A) / Is this just fantasy? (B) / Caught in a landslide (A) / No escape from reality (B)"
      </p>
      <p>
        ABAB gives you more room to develop thoughts before the rhyme lands. It's perfect for storytelling verses.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-foreground">3. ABBA (Enclosed Rhyme)</h3>
      <p>
        Also called "envelope rhyme" because the B rhymes are wrapped inside the A rhymes. This creates a sense of coming full circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        ABBA works beautifully for introspective songs. The structure mirrors the way we process complex emotions—going inward, then returning to where we started.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-foreground">4. XAXA (Open Rhyme)</h3>
      <p>
        Here, only every other line rhymes. The X lines are "free"—no rhyme required. This creates a more conversational, naturalistic feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many modern hits use this pattern because it sounds less "singsongy" and more authentic. You get the memorability of rhyme without feeling locked into a rigid structure.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">The Secret Weapon: Internal Rhymes</h2>

      <p>
        Here's what separates amateur lyrics from professional ones: internal rhymes. These are rhymes that happen <em>within</em> a line, not just at the end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Listen to any Eminem verse, any Lin-Manuel Miranda song, any Kendrick Lamar track. They're packed with internal rhymes that your conscious mind doesn't even notice—but your brain absolutely does.
      </p>

      <p className="italic bg-muted/50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
        "His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy"
      </p>

      <p>
        See how "sweaty" and "heavy" create a subtle echo? And "weak" sets up for "knees"? These internal connections make lyrics feel dense and crafted without sounding forced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tools like <Link to="/">Lyric Genie</Link> can help you find internal rhyme opportunities by showing you rhymes for any word in your line—not just the last word. It's a technique that takes lyrics from good to unforgettable.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">When to Break the Pattern</h2>

      <p>
        Here's the advanced move: once you've established a rhyme scheme, strategically <em>breaking</em> it creates powerful emphasis.
      </p>

      <p>
        When listeners expect a rhyme and don't get it, the unrhymed word stands out. It creates tension. Used well, this technique can make your most important lyric hit harder.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taylor Swift does this masterfully. She'll set up an ABAB pattern, then in the bridge, she'll throw in an unexpected structure that makes the emotional peak land differently.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">Slant Rhymes: Your Secret Friend</h2>

      <p>
        Perfect rhymes (love/dove, heart/apart) are powerful but limiting. Slant rhymes—also called near rhymes or half rhymes—expand your options exponentially.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Home" and "alone" are a slant rhyme. So are "time" and "mine." They don't match perfectly, but they share enough sound similarity to satisfy the brain's pattern-seeking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Slant rhymes let you say what you actually mean instead of contorting your lyrics to fit a perfect rhyme. They sound more natural while still providing that memory-boosting echo.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">Putting It All Together</h2>

      <p>
        The best songwriters don't think about rhyme schemes mechanically. They've internalized these patterns so deeply that the right structure emerges naturally based on what the song needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        But that internalization comes from study and practice. Pay attention to the rhyme schemes in songs you love. Map them out. Notice when patterns break and why.
      </p>

      <p>
        The more patterns you absorb, the more tools you'll have when you sit down to write. And when you're stuck on a lyric, knowing that you can use a slant rhyme, or try an XAXA pattern instead of AABB, can be the difference between finishing a song and abandoning it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rhyme schemes aren't restrictions. They're the invisible architecture that makes songs feel inevitable—like they couldn't have been written any other way.
