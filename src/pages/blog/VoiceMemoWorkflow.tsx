        It's 2am. You're half-asleep. And suddenly, there it is—a melody so perfect it wakes you up. You grab your phone, sing it into a voice memo, and drift back to sleep, confident you've captured something special.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next morning, you open your voice memos. There are 47 untitled recordings. You can't remember which one is from last night. You play a few, but they're out of context now. The magic is gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sound familiar?
      </p>

      <p>
        The gap between capturing an idea and turning it into a finished song is where most great songs die. But it doesn't have to be this way.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">The Capture Problem</h2>

      <p>
        Ideas are fragile. They arrive unannounced, often at inconvenient times, and they don't wait for you to be ready. If you don't capture them immediately, they evaporate.
      </p>

      <p>
        But capture is just step one. The real challenge is building a system that lets you:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
        <li>Find that idea again when you're ready to develop it</li>
        <li>Understand what you were thinking when you recorded it</li>
        <li>Connect related ideas that came at different times</li>
        <li>Move from raw fragment to finished song without losing momentum</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Professional songwriters who maintain prolific output have solved this problem. Here's how.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">The Three-Second Context Rule</h2>

      <p>
        Whenever you capture a voice memo, spend three extra seconds adding context. Before or after singing your melody, say:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
        <li>What the song is about</li>
        <li>The mood you're going for</li>
        <li>A potential title</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That's it. Three seconds. But those few words will save you hours of confusion later.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Upbeat breakup song, maybe called 'Thank You, Next'"—now when you play this memo in a month, you instantly know what you were going for.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">The Inbox → Develop → Archive System</h2>

      <p>
        Here's the workflow that professional writers swear by:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Inbox:</strong> This is where all new ideas go. Voice memos, lyric fragments, title ideas—everything lands here first. No organization required. Just capture.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Develop:</strong> Once a week, review your inbox. Ideas with potential get moved to your "Develop" folder. This is your active workspace—songs you're actually working on.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Archive:</strong> Ideas that aren't working get archived, not deleted. What doesn't resonate today might be perfect six months from now. You'd be surprised how often old ideas find new life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apps like <Link to="/">Lyric Genie</Link> are built around exactly this workflow—giving you a dedicated place for song ideas with voice memos, lyrics, and notes all connected together. The key is having everything in one place so ideas don't get lost across different apps.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">The Weekly Review Ritual</h2>

      <p>
        Capturing ideas is useless if you never revisit them. Build a weekly habit:
      </p>

      <p>
        Every Sunday (or whatever day works for you), spend 20 minutes reviewing your captured ideas. Listen to your voice memos. Read your lyric fragments. Ask yourself:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
        <li>Which of these still excites me?</li>
        <li>Can any of these ideas combine into something bigger?</li>
        <li>What should I work on this week?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This ritual keeps your creative pipeline flowing. You'll never sit down to write and face a blank page—you'll have a library of starting points waiting for you.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">From Fragment to Structure</h2>

      <p>
        So you have a great verse idea. Now what?
      </p>

      <p>
        The next step is identifying what piece of the puzzle you have. Is it:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
        <li><strong>A melodic hook?</strong> This probably wants to be your chorus.</li>
        <li><strong>A story premise?</strong> This is your verse material.</li>
        <li><strong>A twist or surprise?</strong> This might be your bridge.</li>
        <li><strong>A universal statement?</strong> Could work as a title/hook.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Once you know what part of the song you have, you can focus your energy on building out what's missing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">The Scaffolding Technique</h2>

      <p>
        Staring at an empty song structure is paralyzing. Try this instead:
      </p>

      <p>
        Start with placeholder lyrics. Write the worst, most obvious lines you can think of—lines that convey the meaning you want but have zero craft.
      </p>

      <p className="italic bg-muted/50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
        "I'm really sad because you left / Now I feel bad and bereft"
      </p>

      <p>
        Terrible, right? But now you have a scaffold. You know what the line needs to say. You can revise toward something better without the pressure of creating brilliance from nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Write drunk, edit sober" isn't literally about alcohol—it's about separating creation from criticism. Get the ideas down first. Make them good second.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">The Finish Line Problem</h2>

      <p>
        Many songwriters start strong but struggle to finish. They have folders full of 80%-done songs that never quite got there.
      </p>

      <p>
        The solution is brutally simple: set a deadline. Tell yourself you're finishing this song by Friday. Book a co-write for next week and commit to bringing this song. Schedule studio time to record it.
      </p>

      <p>
        External accountability transforms "someday" into "Tuesday." And honestly? A finished imperfect song teaches you more than a perfect unfinished one.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-foreground">The Complete Workflow</h2>

      <p>
        Here's everything put together:
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3 my-4">
        <li><strong>Capture everywhere.</strong> Phone always ready. Three seconds of context on every memo.</li>
        <li><strong>Inbox weekly.</strong> Review captures every week. Move promising ideas to active development.</li>
        <li><strong>Scaffold first.</strong> Use placeholder lyrics to build structure before crafting.</li>
        <li><strong>One song at a time.</strong> Focus on finishing before starting something new.</li>
        <li><strong>Deadline yourself.</strong> External accountability turns ideas into finished songs.</li>
        <li><strong>Archive everything.</strong> Today's reject might be next year's hit.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The system matters more than any individual idea. Build the right workflow, and you'll never waste another 2am melody again.
